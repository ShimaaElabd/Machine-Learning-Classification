# Machine-Learning-Classification


In machine learning and statistics, classification is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data input given to it and then uses this learning to classify new observation. This dataset may simply be bi-class (like identifying whether the person is male or female or that the mail is spam or non-spam) or it may be multi-class too. Some examples of classification problems are: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, bio metric identification, document classification etc.

Here we have the types of classification algorithms in Machine Learning:

1- Linear Classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier

2- Support Vector Machines

3- Decision Trees

4- Random Forest

5- Neural Networks


Here This dataset is "Social Network.csv" consist of user ID, the gender, the age and the estimated salary.
The company has several business clients which can put their ads on. The car company has just launched their new brand
And we're trying to see which of these users of the social network are going to buy this brand based on two variables which are going to be the age and the estimated salary.
